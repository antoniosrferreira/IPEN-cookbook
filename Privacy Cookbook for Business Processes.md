#Disclaimer#
This cookbook is just a raw collection of things, ideas and resources. It is not a commercial product. It is not 100% correct or free of antagonisms (as the WWW is not "by design"). It is by now not suitable for any specific purpose than collecting information - but it shall be in future.

#Personal disclaimer of [MAG]#
As more as I read about privacy, my heart feels that privacy is just a tool. And everybody using tools like a srew-wrench knows, that it can break screws. I'm not looking for 100% privacy, but for freedom. 
Article 2, German constitution: "Die Freiheit der Person ist unverletzlich." - "The freedom of a person is inviolable."

# Motivation #
If you are in Business Process Modelling (BPM), you need to care about the privacy topics. Let’s start with the basics.

## The 7 basic principles of privacy ##
1.  Proactive not Reactive; Preventative not Remedial
2.  Privacy as default setting
3.  Privacy embedded into design
4.  Full functionality – Positive-Sum not Zero-Sum
5.  End-to-End Security – Full Lifecycle Protection
6.  Visibility and Transparency – Keep it Open
7.  Respect for User Privacy – Keep it User-Centric

## Basic concepts of privacy ##
* the right to be forgotten
* the minimum acquisition of data
* the processing by consent
* anonymity
* purpose-specification
* […] help me to continue!

The OWASP project is doing expert surveys to evaluate the Top 10 Privacy Risks as to international security experts. Thanks to FS and his project for providing the information

Reminder: 
This has to be updated regularly using the link on
“Literature”

## Top 10 Privacy Risks (by OWASP / FS) ##
This list is an expert-based rating of the current top 10 IT privacy
risks.

* P1 Web Application Vulnerabilities
* P2 Operator-side Data Leakage
* P3 Insufficient Data Breach Response
* P4 Insufficient Deletion of personal data
* P5 Non-transparent Policies, Terms and Conditions
* P6 Collection of data not required for the user-consented purpose
* P7 Sharing of data with third party
* P8 Outdated personal data
* P9 Missing or Insufficient Session Expiration
* P10 Insecure Data Transfer

# Intro #
By now, this “scrapbook” is mainly motivation and literature references.
Not much content.\
The hope is that we find the way from the motivational part and through
the existing literature and websites to provide content as soon as we
have a strong idea about how it should look like. Furthermore we will
provide content collected on universities and from real-world projects.

As we consider privacy in IT systems, we have to deal with the basic
principles of privacy. As to (3.) we have to embed privacy into design.
As to (2) by default. That means that we have to consider privacy from
the first step on.

Very often in software development in Year 2014 the software development
process begins with an analysis of what is needed, an analysis of the
Business Process (BP) the software has to support.

So we are starting top-down here.

## Basic real-world problems making privacy more difficult ##
(Reasons for the need to preserve data)
* Requirements of completeness for audits
* Requirements for preparation against legal trails
* […] help me to continue!

## The real world outside ##
You can introduce privacy into business process modelling once at each project, or – if you are a consultant – once at each customer. And you can install a separate privacy guiding process in addition to the casual data protection guidelines or compliance guidelines almost every bigger company has. If you enter a fresh startup, you should try to install a
privacy guiding process as data protection guideline, combining everything.

But to be honest, to me this is the boring part of the work and should be automated via standardized documentation (cookbooks) and tools. That’s why I suppose we need a cookbook for that.

The interesting part is to analyze the existing (sometimes older and “established”) business processes and data dictionaries, the business requirements and the current legal prerequisites. Moreover you have to look at the Databases and flat files, the Queues and Enterprise Service Buses and whether all of them are covered in the BP documentation. And –
not for last – the Online- and Offline applications and their BP coverage.

Consider: If a business process (BP) is running untouched for more than 5 years, it will most probably not be up to date in all respects. And each time you pick up a BP you have to ask all the experts and sometimes use a lot of time to get all things done.

# Borderlines #
## Topic borderline ##
In this cookbook we do not want to care much about the engineering or solely cryptographic perspective of privacy within applications. That will be topic of another cookbook. Nevertheless we will take every hint we get and assimilate it as good as we can.

## Cost and security borderline ##
I don’t know why, but I learned that companies usually do not want to show that they care about security or privacy, and want to keep their privacy enforcing projects secret. They do not even want the company name on any scientific slide about the “next generation” things we installed.

The only thing I can estimate about that is that a company’s customer would think: “Hey, they have to improve their privacy ruleset, there must be something wrong about it!”. The opposite is correct. [Kaizen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen) rules.

But – therefore – I cannot supply customer’s project documentation and can only start from now on to tell the customers that everything we do could but needn’t lead to a passage in the cookbook. If you have something you could pseudonymize and supply, you’re welcome.

(Sorry, in Germany we must make a difference between anonymized and pseudonymized as to “BDSG” law.)

# Main document #

- STARTING -

## Lifecycles ##
### Customer Lifecycle ###
If the data of a customer is no longer needed, it can and should be deleted. If a separate part of customer data is no longer needed, it should be disposed.

### Business Process Lifecycle ###
If a Business Process is finished, the data which was collected for this business process only should be deleted. The speed of this removal depends mostly on “Basic real-world problems making privacy more difficult”.

### Data retention in common ###
[…] help me to continue!

## Ideas ##
* Installation of “next generation” access control mechanism as Attribute Based Access Control.
* Installation of “Power to the person described by the data” (sometimes “more power to the user”, which would only sound correct in systems where the user is entering the data on his own).

## Toolsets ##
If you can support tables etc. which can be used with e.g. Open Office or similar, please support.
If you are from a software vendor for BPM, please support.

Danger: The comment “Useable here for\*” in the tables below is very from subjective points of view and towards what the writer thinks on his/her own. Please feel free to get me informed, if something is completely wrong.

<tr><td>Accountability</td><td>Accountability</td><td>by SJE: CONDITIONAL identification, e.g. in a primitive form an self-incriminating statement that I (Stephan Engberg) is this identity (#AXZk45845c) encrypted so only a judge can decrypt it.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Anon...</td><td>Anonymising intermediary</td><td>Example by [MON]: The User is presented with an iframe (other origin) with a form and a textbox, the email address is sent to the intermediary which posts a one-time ID to the containing site (this can be done with JavaScript). The new password along with the ID is sent to the intermediary who forwards it to the user’s email address. The ID is then deleted. The trick would be to make the system distributed i.e. over p2p, so you would not have to have a trusted intermediary. Addition: The intermediary would be trusted to delete the email after it was used. Even if it was co-opted it could only collect the email, not any other information e.g. the containing page url. If it was based on a distributed store then worst case only a subset of emails (without any associated data) could be syphoned off. </td></tr>


<tr><td>Authentication</td><td>Authentication</td><td>by SJE: A specific key used to prove "ownership" of the identity. e.g. an asymetric cryptography, so the owner can prove ownership wihtout showing the key.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Authorization</td><td>Authorization</td><td>by SJE: Cryptographic proof where some party, e.g. a government insitution verify that you belong to a group (with certain rigths) without identiffying you within the group </td></tr>

<tr><td>Consent</td><td>consent</td><td>(copied from SJE, topic: it-law) Consent - at least in Europe, is rather well-defined.You cannot consent to something unspecificed, it has to be purpose specific and informed. Nomatter if citizens use a service that collect data, the provider cannot be free from purpose-limited informed consent. Only explicit exemptions can change this. General marketing is NOT purpose specific. </td></tr>

<tr><td>contextual identity</td><td>contextual identity</td><td>(Provided by SJE):So whatever data provide value can be exhanged as long as it does not violate contextual boundaries, ie. identity becomes identifiable (linkable). </td></tr>

<tr><td>HTPPA</TD><TD>HTTP with Accountability</TD><TD>(Provided by SJE): A new protocol developed e.g. by the MIT, which will automatically monitor the transmission of private data and allow the data owner to examine how it’s being used. Topic is controversial discussed in IPEN. http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2014/whos-using-your-data-httpa-0613</TD></TR>

<tr><td>Identity</td><td>Identity</td><td>As to SJE we should not understand  identity as "assured identification" (worse imaginable and nevery contributing to securty), we should consider identity as a set of security primitives and proofs. Authentication, Accountability, Authorization, Revokation checks, Token transfer. Many of these make use of  advanced such as blinded encryption, mix nets, one-way key derievation. zero-knowledge proofs. </td></tr>

<tr><td>Revokation checks</td><td>Revokation checks</td><td>by SJE: various means that check for loss of rights within a certain context. E.g. so you can loose the right to enter a Stadion due to "hooliganism", fine - as long as everybody else can prove not to have lost such a right without identifying. </td></tr>

## SJE cites #
BY SJE at 02.11.2014 on IPEN list:
There are several questions that need to be raised in this context. 

a) We need trustworthy "bootable" structures including (external) key devices that we can verify and have to trust to both give us control and at the same time provide the basis for multi-party confidence that you are not a criminal in process of cheating. 

b) We need semi-trusted apps that can provide means intra-context to load new functionality that can interact with our basic system without learning anything that can identify devices or transaction unrelated to the specific context. 

c) We need means to Check-in-isolation, i.e. so each componant can be checked for needed upgrades and fetching these without all the system being transparant. Not only because it is used to locate vulnurabilities and smugle in spyware, but also because of e.g. "Super-cookeis" or digital fingerprinting. 

d) But all of this has to be seen in connection with restoring market processes from the "Google Economics" failure. "Free for (identifed) data" is not free, it is the most costly attack on modern society ever allowed to grow. It is the Data-Ebola and require enforcing similar quantantine mechanisms (contextual identity) to be stopped.
